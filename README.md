## Instructions

Each card has a matching pair hidden in the deck. Click each card to reveal the hidden side and find its matching pair by clicking the other card with the matching image.

Once the first card is revealed, the clock starts and will time the game until all of the cards are matched.

After clicking on a pair of cards, the Moves counter will increment by one. All moves are counted and are utilized to determine the star score.

The objective of the game is to match all of the cards in the least number of moves in the quickest time possible. A perfect game is completed in 8 moves.
A three star rating is given to games that are completed in 8-15 moves.
A two star rating is given to games that are completed in 16-24 moves.
A one star rating is given to games that are completed in greater than 24 moves.

After all the cards are matched, a congratulatory popup modal will appear that will display the star rating, the timing of the victory, and the number of moves made.

A "play again" button brings the user back to a new shuffled gameboard.

  Used for animations and some inspiration of my code although I did deviate quite a bit in my own logic.
